This task demonstrates a way to routinely summarize news articles using a Bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory (BiLSTM) model, educated at the CNN/Daily Mail dataset. The goal is to extract important sentences from an editorial to create a concise summary.

This implementation is based totally at the research paper Content Selection in Deep Learning Models of Summarization by using Prof. Kathleen McKeown and Chris Kedzie. It makes use of the CNN/Daily Mail dataset for education, validation, and trying out.
Features

    Extractive Summarization: The version extracts key sentences from an editorial to create a precis.
    BiLSTM Model: Uses a Bidirectional LSTM for sentence category (significance or not).
    Modular Code: The venture is split into multiple Python files for higher readability and maintainability.
